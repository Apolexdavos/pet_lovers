# Pet Lover Project

## Overview

This is an implementation of a platform that supports the communication among pet veterinarians in Vietnam. As far as one may know, the number of pet veterinarian is increasing day by day. While a lot of countries in the world has a fully-developed healthcare platform enhancing the collaboration of veterinarians, such platform in Vietnam has not yet been implemented. Therefore, we, Pet Lover, initiate this project in order to provide a general standard for veterinarians to collaborate and to help users to keep track of the health condition of their lovely pets.
